        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>
          The design process started with user research and wireframing, followed by high-fidelity mockups in Figma. 
          Colors were kept minimal, with bold product images to highlight the shoes. The app supports filtering by size, 
          color, and brand, ensuring users can quickly find what they want.
